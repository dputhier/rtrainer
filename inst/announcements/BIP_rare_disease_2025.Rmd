# Objectives 

The objective of Phase I is to build a strong foundation in R programming, starting with fundamental concepts such as data structures, manipulation, and control flow. As the program progresses, learners will explore data visualization using [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/), mastering its advanced features to create insightful and customized visual representations. Finally, the phase will end up with some elements about object-oriented programming (OOP) in R, covering general concepts and methodologies for structuring user-defined classes.

# Learning modules

You should go through all the modules outlined below. Each topic is designed to enhance your understanding and practical skills, ensuring you can apply R effectively in data analysis and beyond.

| Module | Description |
|--------|------------|
| 01 - [Getting Started with R](https://denis-puthier.shinyapps.io/01_preamble/) | Introduction to understanding basic R syntax. |
| 02 - [Working with Vectors](https://dputhier.shinyapps.io/02_vectors/) | Understanding vectors, R’s primary data structure, and performing basic operations. |
| 03 - [Indexing and Subsetting Vectors]() | Learn how to access, filter, and manipulate vector elements efficiently. |
| 04 - Factors and Categorical Data | Handling categorical variables in R using factors, including ordering and labeling. |
| 05 - Matrices: Working with 2D Data | Creating and manipulating matrices, performing operations, and understanding their structure. |
| 06 - Data Frames: The Heart of R | Introduction to data frames, R’s most widely used structure for handling tabular data. |
| 07 - Data Manipulation with dplyr | Using dplyr to filter, summarize, and transform data efficiently with a tidy approach. |
| 08 - Lists: Flexible Data Storage | Understanding lists and how they store heterogeneous data types in R. |
| 09 - Navigating the File System | Reading and writing files, setting working directories, and managing paths in R. |
| 10 - Data Type Conversions | Converting between different data types (numeric, character, factor, etc.) to ensure consistency. |
| 11 - Conditional Statements in R | Using if, else, and switch statements for decision-making in your R scripts. |
| 12 - Loops and Iterations | Implementing for loops, while loops, and alternatives for iterative programming in R. |
| 13 - Data Visualization with ggplot2: Basics | Introduction to ggplot2, setting up plots, and understanding the grammar of graphics. |
| 14 - Customizing ggplot2 Visualizations | Modifying themes, axes, colors, and labels to enhance your visualizations. |
| 15 - Advanced ggplot2 Techniques | Faceting, combining multiple plots, and working with advanced aesthetics in ggplot2. |
| 16 - ggplot2: Interactive and Specialized Plots | Creating interactive and specialized plots for deeper data exploration. |
| 17 - Writing Functions in R | Creating and using functions to make your R code more modular and reusable. |
| 18 - Object-Oriented Programming in R | Introduction to OOP in R, including S3 and S4 classes for structured programming. |

# Learning evaluation

Your understanding of various aspects of R programming will be assessed through an online web form. The evaluation will primarily focus on concepts covered in learning modules 01-16. The questions will test your knowledge, problem-solving skills, and ability to apply R programming techniques effectively. 

# Note about the pedagological material

The pedagological material is based on the rtainer R library we have been developing during the last years for our students. The library itself is based on learnr and gradethis R packages. The content of this library  is available on [github](https://github.com/dputhier/rtrainer) and can also be installed on your computer. A recent version of R/RStudio is required. For installation:

- install a recent version of R (>4.2.3) from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/). 
- install a recent version of RStudio from [Posit](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/). 
- Start RStudio. In the panel named "Console", at the bottom of the graphical interface, copy and paste successively the following instructions:

  - `install.packages("devtools")`
  - `devtools::install_github("dputhier/rtrainer")``
  - `library(learnr)`
  - `learnr::available_tutorials("rtrainer")``

Look at the tutorial names and start one of them  (here "04_factors") using: 

- learnr::run_tutorial("04_factors", "rtrainer") 


# Questions, remarks, issues

Submit your questions, issues, or feedback by opening an issue on the rtrainer GitHub repository (a GitHub account is required) at:

- [https://github.com/dputhier/rtrainer/issues](https://github.com/dputhier/rtrainer/issues)

# To go further

Once you have mastered the fundamentals of R programming and data visualization with ggplot2, you can explore more advanced and specialized plotting techniques. The ggplot2 [extensions gallery](https://exts.ggplot2.tidyverse.org/gallery/) provides a wealth of additional tools and packages that extend ggplot2’s capabilities. These extensions allow you to create customized, interactive, and highly specialized visualizations tailored to specific analytical needs. Whether you’re interested in animated plots, network diagrams, or enhanced geospatial visualizations, these resources will help you take your R data visualization skills to the next level.
